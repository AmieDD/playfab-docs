# PlayFab SDK overview

PlayFab provides SDKs for many popular engines and platforms. The SDKs fall into broad categories of support:

* Language - SDKs that support specific languages.
* Framework - SDKs that support game building frameworks.
* Game Engine - SDKs that support popular game engines.
* Scripting - SDKs that support popular scripting languages.

The core SDKs are typically wrappers around the PlayFab rest APIs. They facilitate you use of the platform of your choice to perform the core player, admin, and server functions for your PlayFab titles.

In addition, the Multiplayer SDKs provide native C++ libraries that allow you to manage your PlayFab multiplayer services.
