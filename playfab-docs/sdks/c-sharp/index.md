# C#

Currently the C# SDK says:
Our C# SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

This C# SDK is most commonly used as a tool to build apps for the Windows platform and Xamarin to build cross platform titles for iOS and Android. You can use it to wrap terminal commands and create your own Legacy Windows Forms app.

A native C# project can be used two ways:

- Admin tools for maintaining your game
  - Usually, you will want to make synchronous calls back-to-back.
  - Each API call will lock the program while it's executing, but that's not an issue for this type of program.
  - See the comment about `loginTask.Wait()` in the example code below. This is how you'll usually make API calls.

- An actual game coded in native C#
  - You need to take advantage of the async nature of API calls, and the C# async/await feature keywords. For more information about asynchronous programming, see [Asynchronous Programming with async and await (C#)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/async).

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every week, to remain current with the latest API changes.
