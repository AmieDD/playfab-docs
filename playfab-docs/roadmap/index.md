# PlayFab Roadmap
_Last Update: 4/23/2020_

We hope you're all staying safe! With 2020 comes a modern vision of our services that we’re working hard to deliver. 

As always, we want your feedback. The [Feature Requests](https://community.playfab.com/spaces/24/index.html?sort=votes) section of our forum allows you to post, comment, and vote on ideas from our community. Addressing issues also remains a high priority so please continue to share your findings in the [Bugs](https://community.playfab.com/spaces/23/index.html) section of our forums.

Please note that while this roadmap reflects our aspirations, features and timelines are subject to change without notice.

## **Coming Next:**

**_General availability of improved Leaderboards_**

This service is available today in previews. As we further incorporate your feedback, we will make this generally available to all PlayFab users. 

**_Economy and User Generated Content_**

These services will begin to move from private to public preview in the first half of 2021. Our Economy services include redemption, wallet, and inventory capabilities while UGC provides a highly scalable catalog plus content moderation, ratings, and reviews. These services are used to power the Minecraft Marketplace, supporting millions of transactions and the consumption of user generated content at scale. The LiveOps Masterclass with Minecraft [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7VoxGb1oYw) gives a good overview.

## **Available Now:**

**_Release notes on PlayFab GitHib Repo_**

We have created a new public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab) for PlayFab where we communicate service [releases notes](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab/releases) and product updates.

**_Insights (Public Preview)_**

We’re proud to announce that our new completely managed data solution PlayFab Insights is now available in Public Preview. 

This new stand-alone service includes its own pricing currency and an improved data environment with advanced ingestion, export, customization and data retention features. Our goal is to provide petabyte-scale-analytics out-of-the-box. All together this creates a story of ingestion, access, control and reporting that is far beyond what we have offered in the past.

Insights allows you to choose how long you retain data and how much power you want behind your queries; as well as opening up multiple new ways to access data including connecting popular visualization platforms.

A [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4akVBx2gmU0) and full [reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/insights/insights/) are available.

**_Azure Active Directory Authentication_**

Now you can “Sign in with Microsoft” at the bottom of the PlayFab developer login page thanks to Azure Active Directory authentication. This enables one-click access to PlayFab from Partner Center, Azure Portal and other Microsoft portals. When adding users to an existing account, be sure to set the correct authentication provider as specified in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/authentication/aad-authentication/).

**_Multiplayer Servers in South Africa_**

**_Matchmaking_**

[Matchmaking](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/matchmaking/) is publicly available and includes support for back-filled tickets, allowing you to re-fill open slots if players leave mid-game.

[Party](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/networking/) accessibility and translation services are in Private Preview in 20+ languages, making it easier for players to communicate with each other. 

Party C++ SDKs are available for more platforms, including PC, Xbox, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation, so you can connect players with low-latency networking and chat anywhere.

We’ve modernized the user experience, given you more flexibility, and improved usability. This new style is inspired by the [Fluent design language](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/) adopted across Microsoft. 

**_Improved Onboarding_**

For any feature you are not currently using Game Manager now provides notes on prerequisites and links to the quick start guide.
