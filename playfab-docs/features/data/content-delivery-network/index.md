# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

The Content Delivery Network (CDN) is an infrastructure used to deliver assets - such as images, audio, binary content, etc. - to the end user that focuses on speed and availability.

CDN costs are independent of your pricing tier (Essentials, Professional, etc.), and require that you have an active PlayFab payment account:

To set up an active PlayFab payment account, a Studio administrator must log in to Game Manager and navigate to the **Title Overview** page, select the **profile icon** in the top right corner, and then select **Studio billing**.

On the **Studio billing** page enter your payment information.

To locate the cost of CDN, navigate to the **Title Overview** page, select **Content** from the left navigation menu, and then select **File Management** from the list of tabs. 
The cost is located at the top of the **File Management** page. CDN costs are calculated based on the number of downloaded gigabytes per title during the billing period.

> [!NOTE]
> Please use the **Content**->**File Management** tab for more information on this subject, or contact our [developer forum](https://community.playfab.com/) with any questions that you may have.
