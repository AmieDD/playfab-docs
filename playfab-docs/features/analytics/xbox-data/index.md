The Xbox Data-Add On has been created to provide developers with near-real-time analytics from products that are available on the Windows Store, and on Xbox Live services.

Any Xbox or Windows store title - whether existing or new - can enable this add-on to start receiving data to their PlayFab Insights warehouse. This feature does not require adoption of the PlayFab SDK.
